1. writing sequence/order of the routes matter while using the app.use("/", (req, res) => {}) method
2. by default, when you write any url on the top of the browser that's make a get api call
3. app.use("/hello", (req, res) => { // it will cover anything that comes after /hello
    res.send("Hello from SERVER");
});
